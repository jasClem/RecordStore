# RecordStore
Record Store Program
Requires a blank mysql database called "RecordStore" and a user created with all privileges.

Steps:

1: Create a database named RecordStore;
2: Create user 'username'@'localhost'
3: Identified user by 'password';
4: Replace 'username' and 'password' with preferred username and password (Use a unique password, different to the root user)
5: Grant all privileges on RecordStore.* to 'username'@'localhost'
6: Replace the "username" and "password" in the DB class file with what was previously chosen.

This does not work at all.
